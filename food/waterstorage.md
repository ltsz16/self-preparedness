Water is needed for three primary things:

1.  Human consumption
    
2.  Cooking food
    
3.  Cleaning
    
    1.  dishes
        
    2.  clothes washing
        
    3.  removing human waste
        

It should be noted that when considering water storage that water used for cooking counts towards human consupmption (as long as the water is consumed and not waster through evaporation or being thrown away). Also, it is assumed that water supplies can be suppliminted by some, though perhaps extrememly limited, rain fall.

Water Supply
============

*   1 gallon per person & pet per day (3/4 used for consumption, rest for sanitization purposes)
    
    *   Children, nursing mothers, pregnant women and sick people may need more water. Usually up to 2.5 gallons per day
        
    *   A medical emergency might require additional water.
        
    *   If you live in a warm weather climate more water may be necessary. In very hot temperatures, water needs can double.
        

However, prolonged water shortage will require water consumption for other items, such as laundry. Look at where you will do laundry (e.g. a 5-gallon bucket, bathtub or washing machine if there is electricity). The general rule of thumb is to anticipate 27.5 gallons per person per week in prolonged periods (if you plan to maintain a somewhat regular laundry cycle).

The following level breakdown come from the Church and CDC

Level I
-------

Three day supply per person/pet (viz. at least 7 gallons per person/pet)

Level II
--------

Three week supply per person/pet (viz. at least 21 gallons per person/pet, 27.5 per person/pet for prolong periods)

Level III
---------

Three month supply per person/pet (viz. at least 122 gallons per person/pet)

Level IV
--------

Water as can be stored

Consuming your Water Storage
============================

Never throw even one drop away that you can use for something else. Vegetable-washing water can go to your thirsty plants. Bath water can be shared. All used water goes into the toilet. (Keep disinfectant in the toilet, keep the lid down, and the window open﻿—and keep smiling.) A portable toilet may be your solution to this problem but you still will have the problem of disposal.

_**Washing dishes**._ For dishwashing you’ll need two dishpans of hot water﻿—one soapy, one clear. If you have to use cold water, fill your sponge with liquid detergent, wash everything, then rinse in one pan of clear water, changing it as needed. Too much detergent in the diet can cause diarrhea, so go easy on the soap and rinse thoroughly. Greasy pans are a real problem, but you can wipe them out with a paper, pour a little boiling water over them to remove the grease, then wash them with cleanser, and rinse. Avoid frying during this period, if possible.

Your cooking will be simpler during a water shortage. One-dish meals soil fewer dishes. I keep a plastic bowl handy for washing fruits, vegetables, and knives in a hurry, then pour the water into gooey pans or messy dishes. Wash all dishes and pans as soon as you use them. Waiting makes the job harder and wastes water.

_**Drinking water**._ I would boil or treat all water before drinking it, even if this has already been done to store it. Let it boil hard three minutes, then let it cool (covered). When it is cool, pour it back and forth several times between two containers to improve the taste. (A blender can do this for you﻿—as long as there is electricity.) I filter my water after boiling, and this aereates it too. Either a clean cloth or commercial filters will do. You will need to treat any well or creek water you use unless you are absolutely certain it is pure. Boiling or treating all your water is a small price to pay to avoid dysentery, typhoid, or other water-borne diseases.

_**Personal cleanliness**._ It is especially important that people keep clean in this period. A small round plastic dishpan and a handy pitcher of water are very helpful for washing hands and faces. A germicidal soap is good too. Talcum powder is helpful (especially in hot weather), and deodorant is a _must_ for the emergency supply. Keep an aerosol shaving cream for the man in the house. Keep a bucket in the bathroom and kitchen to collect all used water.

_**Washing clothes**._ Washing clothes by hand is a special problem. Be sure you have a detergent that works well in cold water. To scrub clothes, a plastic floor brush and a scrub board (or a plain, heavy piece of wood the same size as a scrub board) are very useful. Let the clothes soak in water and detergent for at least one hour. After that, wring them out one by one, giving any that need it an extra scrub with the brush and laundry soap. For more delicate items, simply roll them on the scrub board under your palms.

Remember that it is always easier to add more soap than to rinse out too much. Do not scrimp in rinsing diapers. You’ll all be miserable if the baby is, and tempers tend to be short when the water is. Remember clothesline and clothes pins in your supply too; your dryer may not be functioning. And save the rinse water for the floor, toilet, etc.

_**The inevitable emergency**._ When your youngest gets into the ink or the honey, or throws up, or something worse, put several quarts of clean water into a clean bucket. Clean your progeny first﻿—lovingly; he’s discovering the world. Then add disinfectant to the water and attack the floor, walls, and anything else he dirtied. This is usually enough for all but the most appalling messes. Older children can and do cooperate, and making a game out of the situation will make it easier for all. Besides, all the crying

Storage Options
===============

*   Store your water where it will not freeze.
    
*   Do not store plastic containers directly on concrete (e.g. on your garage floor, if in garage put them on wood)
    

Containers
----------

*   Use only food-grade containers. Smaller containers made of PETE plastic or heavier plastic buckets or drums work well.
    
*   Clean, sanitize, and thoroughly rinse all containers prior to use. A sanitizing solution can be prepared by adding 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of liquid household chlorine bleach (5 to 6% sodium hypochlorite) to 1 liter (one quart) of water. Only household bleach without thickeners, scents, or additives should be used.
    
*   Do not use plastic milk jugs, because they do not seal well and tend to become brittle over time.
    
*   Do not use containers previously used to store non-food products.
    
*   Avoid plastic containers that are not PETE plastic.
    

Storage
-------

*   Containers should be emptied and refilled regularly.
    
*   Store water only where potential leakage would not damage your home or apartment.
    
*   Protect stored water from light and heat. Some containers may also require protection from freezing.
    
*   The taste of stored water can be improved by pouring it back and forth between two containers before use.
    

Water Pretreatment
------------------

*   Water from a chlorinated municipal water supply does not need further treatment when stored in clean, food-grade containers.
    
*   Non-chlorinated water should be treated with bleach. Add 8 drops of liquid household chlorine bleach (5 to 6% sodium hypochlorite) for every 4 liters (one gallon) of water. Only household bleach without thickeners, scents, or additives should be used.
    

Rain water storage
------------------

*   In Utah you may store water in two covered containers which hold no more than 100 gallons each.
    
*   You may register for permission to store up to 2,500 gallons by making a request [here](https://waterrights.utah.gov/forms/rainwater.asp)
    

Purification Options
====================

*   Distillation
    
*   Boil for 5 minutes
    
*   Iodine/Chlorine
    
    *   Cold or murky water needs a little more disinfectant (four drops per quart) than warm or clear water (two drops)
        
        *   Tincture of iodine 2% is actually much stronger than 10% povidone-iodine solution. Use 5 to 10 drops of tincture of iodine 2% in one quart of water and allow it to sit in the shade for 30 minutes. Again, flush the threads and wipe down the bottle. Use 5 drops for clear or warm water, and up to 10 for cold or cloudy water. Since 10% povidone-iodine solution is weaker, you’ll need 8 to 16 drops per quart of water. Again, use fewer drops for nice looking water and 16 drops for swamp water
            

Ways to Limit Water Consumption in a Drought (but not live on water storage yet)
================================================================================

*   Reuse your dishwashing water by using it to water your garden instead of allowing it to just run down the drain;
    
*   Shower instead of bathing;
    
*   Take shorter showers;
    
*   Do not let the tap run when brushing your teeth;
    
*   Do not flush the toilet if not really necessary, and put a brick in the cistern so that each flush uses less water;
    
*   Reroute the rainwater from your gutters in the winter into water tanks that you can then use to water your garden in the summer
    

Possible Sources of Water in an Emergency
=========================================

*   Water from your home’s water heater tank (part of your drinking water system, not your home heating system)
    
*   Melted ice cubes made with water that was not contaminated
    
*   Water from your home’s toilet tank (not from the bowl), if it is clear and has not been chemically treated with toilet cleaners such as those that change the color of the water
    
*   Liquid from canned fruit and vegetables
    
*   Water from swimming pools and spas can be used for personal hygiene, cleaning, and related uses, but not for drinking.
    
*   Rainwater
    
*   Streams, rivers, and other moving bodies of water
    
*   Ponds and lakes
    
*   Natural springs
