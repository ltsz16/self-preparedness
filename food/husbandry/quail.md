Health Concerns
===============

Consumption

*   Eggs have a stronger flavor than chicken
    

Breeding
========

*   5 females to 1 male. 5:2 is better, but will want larger pen so no fighting
    
*   Breed: Coturnix.
    
    *   **Coturnix** (aka Japanese quail): Best for egg/meat production. Reliant egg layers. Can keep in groups. Mature in 8 weeks. Jumbos 10-12 oz.
        
    *   **King quail** (aka button quail, chinese painted quail): Small, pretty, 8-12 week to mature. Very small eggs. Timid. Donâ€™t do well in cold climates. Do well
        
    *   **Bob white quail**: Usually require a permit (usually through fish & game). Can be aggressive when confined and usually need to pair off during breeding season (though after sometimes can group). 6 months to mature. 6-16 oz in size.
        
    *   **Gamble quail**: Usually require a permit (usually through fish & game). Can be aggressive when confined and usually need to pair off during breeding season (though after sometimes can group). 6 months to mature.
        
    *   **Mountain Quail**: Pretty. Usually require a permit (usually through fish & game). Babies usually require hand feeding. Can be aggressive when confined and usually need to pair off during breeding season (though after sometimes can group). 6 months to mature. 9 oz.
        
    *   **Blue Scale quail**: Can be aggressive when confined and usually need to pair off during breeding season (though after sometimes can group). 6 months to mature. 6-16 oz in size. Difficult to keep in captivity
        
*   Refresh stock once a year
    
    *   Quail live 2-3 years
        

Eggs
----

*   Usually lay an egg a day if 14 hours of light a day (viz. add artificial light in winter)
    
*   Collect over a one week period and incubate all at once
    
    *   Collect daily (more frequent during winter)
        
*   Take 16-18 weeks to incubate, day 19, 19.5 usually will start hatching in most active. Some not until day 20 or 21
    
*   60-100% hatch rate is a good rate
    
*   6-9 weeks for chick to become an adult
    

### Cull Eggs

*   If heavily soiled in poop. Can wash and eat but not incubate
    
*   Cracked
    
*   Not look normal
    
*   Significantly larger (usually double yolkers, but can eat)
    

### Store eggs

*   Collect daily, store for week
    
*   Store pointy end down
    
*   Can use egg carton, but better is a seed tray upside down with bottoms but and store in a cooler
    
*   Want in 50-60 degree range
    
*   Spray with listerine spray to spray eggs to kill bacteria on shell
    
    *   Original (yellow) listerine with 1:1 solution with water
        
    *   Spray lightly before storing
        
*   Move eggs 2x a day (raise one end of cooler and then the other side). Keeps egg from sticking to shell
    

### Incubator

*   styrofoam work great but will probably want a digital thermostat
    
    *   Ideal temp.: 99.5 degrees
        
    *   Humidity: ~ 50% (at least first 15 days) then increase to 65-70%
        
*   Egg turner will make like easier otherwise you need to manually turn eggs several times a day
    
*   Two incubators are great so can rotate (and clean in between) and one for hatching (with egg turner) and one for after they are born
    
*   Day 15 remove from egg turner and put in on floor of incubator (or move to second incubator)
    
*   Leave 2 days after hatch, try not to open incubator during this time
    
    *   Quickly try to remove those who are dry
        
    *   Allow eggs in incubator until day 22

How many do I need for food?
============================

*   Plan one bird per person
    
    *   Higher in protein than chicken meat
        
*   Assume
    
    *   5:2 female to male
        
    *   1 egg a day per female
        
        *   35 eggs a week
            
        *   Assume 10 cannot incubate (e.g. broken, dirty, etc)
            
        *   Assume hatch rate of 60%
            
            *   15 chicks hatch to brooder
                
                *   Assume loose 3, leaving 12 chicks
                    
        *   12 weeks (3 incubation, 9 growing)
            
*   For eating
    
    *   5 female will provide 1 meal a month for a family of 4
        
    *   20 quail family 4 meal once a week
        
*   For eggs
    
    *   5 quail eggs ~ 1 chicken egg
        
        *   5-10 quail for family 4 for eggs a few times a week
