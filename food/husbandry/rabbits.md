Legal
=====

You must submit an [application](http://centervilleut.net/file/2019/08/Chicken-and-Rabbits-Application.pdf) to the city for permission to have a few animals in order to feed your family. There are [laws](https://centerville.municipalcodeonline.com/book?type=Zoning#name=12.55.240_Raising_Of_Chickens_And/Or_Rabbits) in place in Centerville regarding the raising of rabbits. You are limited to 6 rabbits with a caviat that excess must be killed or removed by 5 months old. However this is ok as you are allowed to keep excess rabbits until 5 months old and rabbits are usually processed around 2.5-3 months old.

Health Concerns
===============

Breeds
======

*   New Zealand
    
*   Californian Cross
    

Breeding
========

*   Start breeding does at 4 months and males at 6 months; rebreed when babies 2-3 weeks old
    
*   Only need one buck per 30 does, but if want more variaiety rule of thumb is 1 buck per 4 does
    
*   Retire breeders aroung 1-2 years (depending on how doe is doing)
    
    *   Pick new does for breeder whose mom made good nests, had large litters, and took good care of babies
        
*   Cannot breed two from the same litter (no litter mates)
    
*   Don’t breed on the ground (usually in cages up off the ground) in a structure (e.g. barn). Helps protect them
    
*   Gestation period 28-32 days
    

Mating
------

*   Bring the doe to the buck
    
*   Buck needs to mount and fall off at least three times
    
    *   Watch until happen at least twice then do your regular chores and can come back circa an hour to separate them
        

Nesting box
-----------

*   Metal is great material with pegboard bottom, but not a screen/hardware clothOne with a larger top stand is good as it gives mom a place to hop up and stand
    
*   Have some hay (cheap) for nesting material and put some in the box and some outside; rabbit will redo their way.
    
*   Some moms make bad nests (will eat material). Try adding more. If keep eating watch and when she starts pulling her hair quickly stock up the nesting box with material
    
*   Clean
    
    *   Once within first 3 weeks
        
        *   Keep mom’s fur (save). Reconstruct nest and re-add fur
            
*   Setup on day 25 of gestation.
    
    *   Sign she will start cramming things in her mouth to make a nest
        
    *   Put nesting box into her cage
        
    *   Keep there until day 35, if no birth by this day then rebreed

Birth
=====

*   Babies called kits
    
*   Just before giving birth a rabbit will pull fur from body and add to nest (usually a few hours before giving birth)
    
*   Often will give birth during the night
    
*   If big litter (e.g. over 8) and another also gave birth with 1-2 days and it smaller can take some (1-2) from larger and add to smaller
    
*   Checkup
    
    *   If new doe/first birth then usually wait 24 hours before doing anything to the babies, but check
        
        *   Bring something they like to eat to preoccupy them while checking babies and remove nesting box completely
            
            *   Count number
                
            *   Ensure healthy (often a few will die)
                
*   Birth
    
    *   If babies born on wire instead of nesting box try to put them into box (with those still alive)
        
    *   Nest should be in back of nesting box (a good mom will make it here)
        
        *   Not as big of a deal in summer but want to move to back. Will also help teach mom

Babies
======

*   Want babies to be tame
    
    *   Handle babies every day or every other day
        
*   Mom will usually nurse entire litter only twice a day so leave alone if you see mom in nesting box
    
*   If you find baby outside nesting box put it back in
    
    *   Check in the morning and before night
        
*   As move to more solid foods babies can get dyareea or sticky butt. The latter can cause issues
    
    *   Check for it daily
        
*   Wheen around 5 weeks and put in rabbit tractor
    
*   Keep nesting box in with mom until 3 weeks old
    
    *   Then pull out nesting box

How many do I need for food?

Roughly 1 doe=7 litters/year with 6 babies per litter (this is breeding every 6 weeks avg).
