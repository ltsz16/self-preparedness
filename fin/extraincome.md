Tutor
-----

If you’re in college chances are you’ve got in demand knowledge on particular subjects. A great way to profit from your knowledge is tutor high school aged kids who are struggling.

Parents of struggling high school and elementary aged students would love to have a college student tutor their children. Advertise your services in places that are sure to catch the eye of parents.

Check out our guide on [how to get started tutoring in college](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/18961/6-online-tutoring-jobs-college-students/) (and you can do it online as well).

Partner With Uber Or Lyft
-------------------------

This is currently my favorite way to earn some extra money each month. And if you like to drive, this is a pretty easy way to get that extra cash.

Ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft have become extremely popular over the last couple of years. And as a driver, you can earn decent money if you focus on it.

Babysit
-------

If you have patience and a place where you can babysit you can earn extra cash from the comfort of your home.

The babysitter I use charges $20 per day per kid. This is actually a pretty low price so you may be able to get much more money for your services.

Just don’t take on too many kids at once. Babysitting is definitely a job that can be frustrating at times depending on the ages of the kids you’re watching. Keep that in mind.

Write
-----

There are all kinds of ways you can earn money from writing.

You can write for blogs, magazines, content mills, or local businesses. Your first step in finding a writing job is deciding what kind of writing you want to do.

By writing for magazines you can earn as much as $500 an article – but this is a harder field to break into. If you choose to write for blogs you can average $20 – $25 per blog post when first starting out. Or, if you’re looking for the really easy route you can write for a content mill like [textbroker.com](https://textbroker.com/). Just be aware that content mills will pay the least amount of money.

Sell Your Junk
--------------

If you’ve been holding on to too much stuff for a while why not de clutter and make money while you’re at it?

You can sell clothes, shoes, and home décor fairly well on Facebook Yardsales. For items like DVDs, CDs, college textbooks, and video games give Amazon a try. For large items Craigslist will do the trick.

Here’s [10 crazy ways to earn $10,000](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/18881/crazy-ways-to-make-10000/) – and a lot of it involves selling junk.

Sell Other Peoples Junk
-----------------------

If you’re good at selling your own stuff you can take it a step farther and sell other peoples unwanted items.

To do this you’ll need to draw up a contract which states you get a commission for successfully selling an item. You can try doing this with your friends and family first and if it works good advertise your services to others.

Sell Photos
-----------

Stock photos are in demand. If you’re a photographer or just enjoy taking photos you can actually make money by selling them.

The cool thing is that you can sell the same photo over and over again. All you do is create an account with a place like [shutterstock.com](https://shutterstock.com/) or [freedigitalphotos.net](https://www.freedigitalphotos.net/) and every time someone buys one of your photos you’ll receive a commission.

If you build up a large portfolio of photos you can enjoy repeat passive income.

Join a Focus Group
------------------

Businesses use focus groups to help perfect their product or service. When you attend a focus group you’ll be giving your opinions and reviews on a certain product or service. The best part is that you get paid for doing this!

There are focus groups in all types of areas. Some focus groups are conducted online while others are conducted in person. To find a focus group to participate in just perform a Google search for “focus groups in your area.”

There are also online focus groups and surveys that you can take to earn money. Here’s a couple of our favorites:

Clean Houses
------------

There are many people who either hate cleaning their house or just don’t have time for it. If you enjoy cleaning or can at least put up with it to earn some extra cash, this can be an easy solution for you.

You can charge around $50 per house meaning you’ll only have to clean two houses per month to earn your extra $100!

Become a Mystery Shopper
------------------------

Mystery shopping is one of those side gigs that feels too good to be true: you get paid to buy things!

Many companies will offer you money to go in and buy a certain product and review the service you get. Other jobs will be based on service only. For instance you’ll have to test drive a car and rate the service you received at a dealership.

Either way you can easily earn an extra $100 a month by becoming a mystery shopper. You can find mystery shopping jobs at [bestmark.com](https://bestmark.com/)
