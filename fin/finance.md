Financial steps (in order)
==========================

“President Ashton’s process” refers to a process recommeded by the then president of the quorum of twelve apostles and since recommended by the Church in its [financial literacy programs.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/33293_eng.pdf) It is a simple approach to eliminating debt by using funds freed up when one debt is retired to pay down remaining debt.

**WARNING:** Certain individuals teach a fixed budgeting amount, such as 50%/20%/30% taught by Dave Ramsey, and sometimes espoused by members. These are not taught, nor endorsed, by the Church in its literature. Most of these might work if you have a small family of 4 or less individuals, with children in close ages. They do not take into account large families are large spreads in children’s ages. They also create errors in forcing families to conform to percentages which may not reflect one’s financial situation. The best approach is to consider the council of others who are successful and who have a similar family situation as you but to then prayfully consider as head(s) of households what is the best financial plan and budget for your goals and situation.

**NOTE:** There is a special excel workbook which I have created which you may use. It helps with budgeting, debt reduction plans and will auto. calculate most of your ratios below as well as other things. You may download it and use it (your information remains separate and private). There is a video on how to use it.

**Steps**

1.  Identify your vision statement(s) for all spending (to identify your stewardship)
    
2.  Identify what constitutes failure (for regular accountabilty)
    
3.  Assess your current financial standing
    
    1.  Evaluate tithing paid, are you current?
        
    2.  Create a _balance sheet_ (this should be updated at least once a quarter; your financial situation improves if your net worth increases each time it is prepared)
        
    3.  Create a _cash flow statement_ (this will be helpful for creating your budget later on)
        
    4.  Calculate your:
        
        1.  _Debt ratio_ (liabilities/net worth; a low ratio is best)
            
        2.  _Current ratio_ (liquid assets/current assets; a high ratio shows cash available to pay bills)
            
        3.  _Liquidity ratio_ (liquid assets/monthly expenses; shows number months you can pay living expenses in an emergency, high ratio is desirable)
            
        4.  _Debt-payments ratio_ (monthly credit payments/take-home pay; want a ratio less than 20%)
            
        5.  _Savings ratio_ (monthly savings/gross income; should be at least 10%)
            
    5.  Evaluate your current level(s) of protection
        
        1.  Health insurance coverage
            
        2.  Home/renters insurance
            
        3.  Trasportation (e.g. auto, motorcycle, boat) insurance
            
        4.  Life insurance
            
        5.  Disability/dismemberment insurance
            
    6.  Calculate curernt level(s) of savings
        
        1.  Retirement
            
        2.  Children’s weddings

President Ashton Process
========================

“A debt-elimination calendar can help you reduce or eliminate debt. Mark off several columns on a piece of paper. In the first column on the left, write the names of the months, beginning with the upcoming month. At the top of the next column, write the name of the creditor you want to pay off first. It may be the debt with the highest interest rate, or the earliest pay-off date. List the monthly payment for that creditor until the loan is repaid as shown in the illustration above. At the top of the next column, record the name of the second creditor you want to repay, and list payments due each month. After you have repaid the first creditor, add the amount of that monthly payment to your payment to the second creditor. (In the example above, notice that the family finished making monthly payments on their credit card. They then added $110 to the $70 furniture payment, creating a new monthly payment of $180.) Continue the process until all loans are repaid.”
