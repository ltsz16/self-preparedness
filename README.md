List taken from President Benson’s talk “[Prepare Ye](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1973/10/prepare-ye?lang=eng)”

Counsel
=======

President Benson quoted President Woodruf as a second witness: “The day will come,” said President Wilford Woodruff, “when, as we have been told, we shall all see the necessity of making our own shoes and clothing and raising our own food. …”

Of special note:

[Family Preparedness, President Kimball](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1976/04/family-preparedness?lang=eng)

In the above talk He starts by stating: “Brethren and sisters, I commend to you the excellent addresses that have been given here this morning by Sister Barbara Smith, president of the Relief Society, and the Brethren. As I listened to their addresses, I kept thinking over and over of something the Savior said,“Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?” It rolled over and over and over in my mind: “Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?”

In addition to his counsel President Kimball explicitly asked the Saints to study those following talks

**Levels**
==========

In the various sections you will find things broken out into levels. These are designed mostly for conveinance. Level I items are the bare minimum that you should have and are considered the goal. After having secured a Level I then the other levels are there to help one to be able to expand an area to be ore prepared or to live more comfrotably. They should be fulfilled in order but do not need to be fulfilled. Level II are considered more important, or of more frequent use, than level III.
